**Repository:** https://github.com/DataBooth/max-learning  
**Version:** 0.3.0

A hands-on learning repository for Modular's MAX Engine, featuring six progressive examples from element-wise operations to transformer models.

**Key Features:**
- Minimal examples highlighting pure MAX Graph API without abstractions
- DistilBERT achieving 5.58x speedup vs PyTorch on M1 CPU
- First reported MAX Graph inference on Apple Silicon GPU (element-wise ops)
- 49 comprehensive tests with correctness validation
- Complete benchmarking framework with MAX vs PyTorch comparisons
- MLP regression and CNN MNIST implementations
